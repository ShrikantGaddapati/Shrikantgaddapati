Whenever you have to filter an array Javascript inbuilt method to filter your array is the right choice to use. Filter let you provide a callback for every element and returns a filtered array.

The main difference between forEach and filter is that forEach just loop over the array and executes the callback but filter executes the callback and check its return value. 

If the value is true element remains in the resulting array but if the return value is false the element will be removed for the resulting array.
